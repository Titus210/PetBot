## Error Handling in TypeScript React Registration Form with Flask Backend

### Issue Description:
I am encountering two distinct errors while implementing a TypeScript React registration form with a Flask backend and SQLite3 database. The errors are as follows:

1. **SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input:** This error occurs at line 39 of `SignUpForm.tsx` during the `handleSubmit` function.
2. **POST http://localhost:5173/register 404 (Not Found):** This error is reported at line 31 of `SignUpForm.tsx` in the console.

### Code Review:
Upon reviewing the provided code, I've identified a couple of potential areas that might be causing these errors:

1. **Flask Backend (Python):**
    - The Flask backend seems to be set up correctly with routes for registration and login.
    - However, there could be an issue with the endpoint `/register` not being properly defined or accessible.

2. **Frontend (React TypeScript):**
    - The `handleSubmit` function in `SignUpForm.tsx` seems to handle form submission. However, there might be an issue with how the response is being parsed or handled.
    - Additionally, the POST request is being made to `/register`, but it's resulting in a 404 error, indicating that the endpoint is not found.

### Potential Solutions:
Here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issues:

1. **Backend Debugging:**
    - Ensure that the Flask server is running and accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.
    - Double-check the Flask routes (`/register` and `/login`) to ensure they are correctly defined and implemented.
    - Check for any typos or misconfigurations in the Flask routes.

2. **Frontend Debugging:**
    - Verify that the frontend is correctly sending the POST request to the backend.
    - Check the network tab in the browser's developer tools to see the details of the request and response.
    - Ensure that the JSON response returned from the Flask server is valid and complete.
    - Debug the `handleSubmit` function in `SignUpForm.tsx` to ensure proper error handling and response parsing.

3. **General Debugging:**
    - Make sure that the database connection is properly established and that the necessary tables exist.
    - Check for any errors or exceptions thrown in the Flask server logs.
    - Verify that the frontend and backend are communicating over the correct ports and endpoints.

### Requested Assistance:
If you've already attempted the above steps and are still facing issues, please provide additional details such as:

- Any additional error messages or console logs from the Flask server or the frontend.
- Any recent changes or updates made to the codebase that might have caused these errors.
- Any specific debugging steps you've already taken or additional context that might help in diagnosing the issue.
